        <p class="">
          Those who have a penchant for river sports make it a point to indulge in rafting on the Siang River which is so thrilling. 
          Geographical explorers of the past used to address this river as the 'Missing link' while trying to unravel the link between the Brahmaputra of Assam and Tibet's Tsangpo River. 
          As per Tibetan belief, the Siang River is considered as 'horse mouth river' and its sands are actually emeralds that flows towards east. 
          They also believe that one can become as strong as a horse by drinking its water.
